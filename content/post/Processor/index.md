# Processor

The beginning of the first processors work with few transistors and they were inapplicable to determine tasks. In the actual, the processors have more transistors - thousand of millions - improving the efficiency being more accessible to build computers, smartphones, embedded systems, etc. According to the Moore Law say that the number of transistors in the processor grow x2 each year. However, The barriers that impose the reduction of Silicon or Germany are very defiant.


## Computer's Components

The computer current model has the most similarity to the model proposed for [John von Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) in 1945. This model is based on the analytic machine of [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) of 1819; ideas that materialized we today know us.

The way to understand how a computer works are simple. The Nucleo is the part that interprets the orders transforming the data that have storage through of orders. These orders are attributed to the programs, e.g. compute one mathematical operation, search one file, etc.


One processor is capable of understanding the instructions.
Doing:
1. interprets the instructions and
2. is capable of generating electrical signals for the system functioning.

The memory is the component that stores data and the instructions of each data. Each memory has one direction â€œ[memory address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address)". In [John von Newman's architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture), the memory is stored in distinct from the data and instructions. However, in the [Harvard architecture](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arquitectura_Harvard) exists one specific memory to the data and the instructions.

Finally, the inputs/outputs are one collection of components that permit the computer to connect and communicant to the exterior world and give instructions.
