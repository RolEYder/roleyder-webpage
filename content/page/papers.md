 #### [Mathematics In the Minesweeper](https://github.com/RolEYder/MinesReact/blob/master/docs/paper.pdf)
**Abstract**: In this paper, we explore different mathematical approaches in Minesweeper like computational algorithms, NP-Complexity, and matrix analysis. In the processes, I present strategies to satisfy computational complex algorithms such as heuristic h-neighbor adjacent.
