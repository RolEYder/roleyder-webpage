## About me.


### I'm an Computer Science Research and Puzzles Lover.

My childhood was very normal. On thing that remembers is when I had my Nintendo64 but, it became unhelpful. So that I tried to fix but just found the problem when I was 12 years.

Exist a book that change my world perspective called Calculos Superiores en Quimica Fisica by Avery Saw, and I said I do not die without knowing something about this book. hehe! This book I did never return it to the primary high school...

After arrived at the high school I knew HTML and C++. Already over there, I started to read books about programming and technologies and also build my applications; [GreenTree](https://github.com/RolEYder/GreenTree) & [SARS-Cov-19](https://github.com/RolEYder/COVID-19-Analytics) API are my best creations in the high school stage. Currently, I do MSc in Computer Science and Mathematics.
