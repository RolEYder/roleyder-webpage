## About me.


### I'm an Computer Science Research and Puzzles Lover.

My childhood was very normal.  I still remember when I had my Nintendo64 buy, it got unhelpful after a while. So that I tried to fix but just found the problem when I was 12 years.
There is a book that changes my world perspective called Cálculos Superiores en Química Física by Avery Shaw, and I said I do not die without knowing something about this book :).  This book I did never return to primary school in 8th grade.

Throughout Polytechnic Institute, I started to learn about software and computers, learning  HTML, CSS, C#, and C++. I learned Linux by myself, that it took me to erase the windows disk accidentally in the installation process, trying to create a dual-boot. But, mistakes are part of the learning process. Then,  I started to download tons of books about Linux to get acquainted with the OS of my life Ubuntu and ArchLinux.

I’ve participated in many competitions like mathematics and literature (both two twice). The second time that I participated in the Regional Mathematics Olympics I was between the ten finalists and in the Regional Literature Olympics 4th position.

When I was 18 years old, I got my first job in Software Engineering at Grupo Mediasoft. That job was very difficult for me, not in the sense of programming stuff…, but I don’t have free time in my daily activities to read something, just one lapse of 1 hour to lunch, from 8 AM to 6 PM. I completed the day very tired and incapable of doing something after that hour.  

Now I love to code (every day I need it done, on the contrary, my day feels incomplete).

Currently, I do an MSc in Computer Science and Mathematics.
